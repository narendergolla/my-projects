<h3>About me<h3>
<p>I'm Angela, I'm a developer with a passion for teaching.
I'm the <strong>lead instructor </strong>at the London App Brewery,
London's leading <strong>Programming Bootcamp.</strong>I've helped
hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and
change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been
invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and
Google to teach their employees.
My first foray into programming was when I was just 12
years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game.
Since then, I've made hundred of websites, apps and
games.</p>
